üöó Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using a supervised machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various attributes of vehicles such as brand, manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and more.                                   

üìå Project Overview                                                                                                                                       

The Car Price Prediction project utilizes regression techniques to predict the price of a car based on historical data. This is useful for platforms like OLX, CarDekho, or CarWale where accurate pricing is crucial for sellers and buyers.
